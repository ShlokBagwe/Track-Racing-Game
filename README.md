## 🏎️ Track Racing Game (Pygame)

A simple 2D top-down racing game built with **Python** and **Pygame**, where the car moves and rotates on a static track. This version features car controls, collision with track borders, and finish line detection.

### 🎮 Current Features

* 🔁 Car rotation and forward/backward movement
* ⛽ Acceleration and friction logic
* 🧱 Track boundary collision (bounce back)
* 🏁 Finish line detection and car reset
* 🔄 Image scaling and rotation utilities
