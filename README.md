Track Racing Game
A 2D top-down racing game built with Python and Pygame, where you race against a computer-controlled car on a looping track.

This project is based on the Tech With Tim tutorial but significantly extended with several unique features and improvements.

🎯 Key Features
🚗 Player vs Computer car racing

⏱️ Realistic acceleration, rotation & friction mechanics

⛔ Collision detection with track borders

🎬 Start countdown (3-2-1) before race begins

🏁 Lap tracking system with custom lap win condition

🏆 Win/Loss screen after reaching the finish condition

🏠 Custom home screen with Play, Options, and Quit options

🎨 Vehicle selection menu with clickable car options

📊 On-screen lap counters for both player and computer

🕹️ Controls
Key	Action
W	Accelerate
S	Brake/Reverse
A	Turn Left
D	Turn Right
Enter	Start Game
Space	Open Vehicle Selection
Esc	Quit Game

🖼️ Assets
All images used (cars, track, background) are stored in the Images/imgs/ directory.
Assets are resized and masked dynamically for better collision detection.

📌 Note
No collision logic between player and computer cars is implemented (intentionally kept simple for smoother gameplay).

The game's structure was redesigned for clarity and modularity, including the abstraction of car logic and UI screens.
